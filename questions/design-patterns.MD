_Note: Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would._

### 1. Explain what is a pattern?

Design Pattern is a typical solution to commonly occurring problem in software design. You could compare DP to a blueprint that can be taken and customized to solve a particular design problem in your code.

### 2. Why we should use design patterns?

The most important reason is that patterns simplify the design and support of programs.

- Tried and tested solutions.
- Code unification - you create fewer bugs, since you use typical unified solutions where all hidden bugs have already been discovered.
- Universal programmersâ€™ vocabulary - instead of explaining some problem you can use pattern name that will be enough for another developer to understand the problem.

### 3. What are the main categories of design patterns?

- Creational: all about creating new objects.
- Structural: structuring your classes effectively, making the relationships minimal etc.

### 4. What is _Singleton_ pattern?

Ensure that your class have only one instance and provide a global pointer to access it.

### 5. What is _Builder_ pattern?

Separate construction of a complex object from its representation, so you can modify it and create different representations depending on your builder.

### 6. What is _Abstract Factory_ pattern?

Interface for creating families of object related / dependent on each other without using a concrete classes.

### 7. What is _Factory method_ pattern?

Interface method for creating an object but letting subclasses decide on what class will be instantiated.

### 8. What is _Object pool_ pattern?

### 9. What is _Prototype_ pattern?

Creating new objects by coping existing ones without compromising their internals.

### 10. What is _Adapter_ pattern?

Adapter is a special object that converts calls sent by one object to the format that another object can understand. Adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes.

### 11. What is _Bridge_ pattern?

Structural design pattern that lets you split a giant class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies, abstraction and implementation, which can be developed independently of each other.

### 12. What is _Composite_ pattern?

Composing objects into tree structures and allowing clients to work with them as if they were individual objects.

### 13. What is _Decorator_ pattern?

Attaching new behaviors to the objects by placing them inside of a wrapper that contains those behaviors

### 14. What is _Facade_ pattern?

### 15. What is _Flyweight_ pattern?

### 16. What is _Private Class Data_ pattern?

### 17. What is _Proxy_ pattern?

### 18. What is _Chain of responsibility_ pattern?

### 19. What is _Command_ pattern?

### 20. What is _Interpreter_ pattern?

### 21. What is _Iterator_ pattern?

### 22. What is _Mediator_ pattern?

### 23. What is _Memento_ pattern?

### 24. What is _Null object_ pattern?

### 25. What is _Observer_ pattern?

### 26. What is _State_ pattern?

### 27. What is _Strategy_ pattern?

### 28. What is _Template method_ pattern?

### 29. What is _Visitor_ pattern?
